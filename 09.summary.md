# Summary

Compose in code.

Perform on a controller.

All these features together result in a kind of 
performance ecosystem to play in.


## Pros and cons

- pros
  - compose code up front (I love this)
  - performance is less stressful
  - big/important changes are easy to control
- cons
  - not as much open improv as I'd like
  - if I have an idea to go off script I can't really do it


## Final words

Everything here is just a suggestion or a tool. 

You can apply all of these concepts to software synths,
or software controls (e.g. DAWs) too. 

Pick and choose the bits that work for you!
