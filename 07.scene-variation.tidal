Scene Variation
---------------

This isn't a very interesting example but it can result in big
musical changes. 

My drum machine has "scenes" which are set on a MIDI CC control.
It defaults to scene zero. 
It's as easy as using value "1" to set Scene 1, value "2" to set Scene 2, etc

-- range scene from 0 to 3
let sceneRange = (range 0 3 $ (cF 0 "90"))
    scene pat = ccv pat # ccn 92 # rytm
