# Hardware Integration With Tidal

This is how I use Tidal to integrate and perform with MIDI-based hardware. 

TOP SECRET EYES ONLY SHHHH!!

This presentation is specific to my preferences, but maybe you
can use these ideas in your Tidal coding too.

You can apply everything here to software-based MIDI too. 


## why

- allows me to use a controller instead of typing


## loose agenda

- Tidal/MIDI basics
- my simple hack for turning things on/off
- using a MIDI CC input range of 0-1 to control other Tidal features
- all the MIDI input things I like to do in Tidal
